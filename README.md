# Enhanced .NET Core Template(s) Boilerplate Code

The Enhanced Boilerplate Template(s) were inspired by a personal need to have 
preferred project architecture files for a particular template out of the box.
An immediate benefit to this approach is faster setup time for simple project
architectures (or even complex! :shipit:). Consumers require minimal refactor
effort to get started.
